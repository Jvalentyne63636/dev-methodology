<div class="container" id="Waterfall">
    <div class="card pad">
        <h1 class="subtitle"> Waterfall Development Model </h1>

        <p> The Waterfall Model is sequential. Only when one phase is finished, does the next phase begin. This allows the programmers to focus on each segment and complete it to the best of their
            ability without rushing or getting confused with dealing with all the segments at once. The stages are ordered for the application or website in question to be as planned and bug free as
            possible by slowly completing the planning phase, moving onto the development phase and then onto the testing and fixing phase before pushing the update or product. This also means that
            if you wish to modify on one of the stages, you need to follow through the flowchart to make verify everything else works because this development model strides on sequentially checking
            every step in order to minimize the risk of any bugs. However, changes do not come often with the Waterfall method as it's built and developed to be effective first time round.
        </p>
        <p> The Waterfall Methodology includes a lot of documentation throughout the whole process which does consume time, however it does store all the details throughout the project such as the coding
        standards and change logs and reasoning behind why specific solutions and concepts were chosen etc...</p>

                </center>
        </div>
        <P> There is a con to this development phase and it means that customer feedback won't be taken into account for release on each update as the development team produces and tests it
            themselves. This development phase is however recommended to already established firms who have a reputation to hold, releasing updates with bugs could damage their reputation so testing on
            their own behalf is crucial before pushing updates.</P>
        <p> An advantage to this Methodology however is that every step is taken slowly and safely to ensure every update pushed is well thought out, planned and executed to it's finest which means it is
            unlikely the update or change will be executed poorly.
        </p>

<div class="container" id="Agile">
    <div class="card pad">
            <h1 class="subtitle"> Agile Development Model </h1>

            <p> The Agile Methodology is effective and with big organizations and firms especially. Agile Methodology consists of a very collaborative, cross-functional team with high communication. The
                team is made of many individuals with different expertise that work on a big project together and communicate often so everyone in the project has a clear understanding of how the project
                is going with everyone and what has and is not working. Agile Methodology consists of frequent meetings however, they are short, fast meetings because Agile Methodology is centered
                around short meetings, small documentation and large amounts of development. It consists mostly of physical development towards the project. </p>
        <P> Agile Methodology is also very iterative which means it endorses frequent changes to the software as it completes loops of this development. AAfter the development is done, iterate over
            the project again and redevelop it to get a better version of the project. This comes into ties with their time structure. Agile Methodology uses a time structure that gives them a certain
            window of time e.g. 2 weeks. And they must implement the features they strive towards in the project, if there is extra time, they can integrate new features or enhance existing ones.
        </P> <p> An advantage of Agile Methodology is the fast and repetitive development towards the project which means the time is effectively consumed instead of wasting a lot of time planning
        and in meetings or documentation noting. There is also excellent communication between the developers involved as there are frequent but short meetings so everyone involved is up to date
        on where the project is in its stages.
            </p>

                </center>
            <p> Lastly, Agile Methodology does include customer feedback as a final check on their project before ending its development in that iteration cycle. This allows final testing and feedback
            by examples of customers that would purchase the software so they can better adapt to their customer needs. A con from this methodology is that customer feedback is only at the end of the
            iteration cycle so if customers do not like the project, many weeks are at waste which could have been fixed by collecting feedback after every update pushed.</p>

<div class="container" id="Extreme Programming">
    <div class="card pad">
        <h1 class="subtitle"> Extreme Programming Model </h1>

        <p> Extreme programming is efficient because it is the practise of frequent updates and features supported only when needed. This means the programmers
            can push updates, customer feedback, new features etc.. frequently because the problem is solved in small but many steps. In addition, many segments towards fixing
            the problem are constantly redone as the problem is better understand by the programmer so they can produce a more efficient or more effective solution.
        Furthermore, pushing updates in many segments allows customer feedback to help enhance their program or website and as requirements for the task naturally change
        according to the situation, the programmers can adapt to it by pushing the frequent updates. This allows the application or website in question to increase in
        quality overtime however, this comes at an opportunity cost of producing a new feature or updating/taking in customer feedback to help in new areas which haven't
            been produced yet.</p>
        <p> Before pushing these frequent updates, and alongside pair programming. Extreme Programming also undergoes unit testing. Unit testing is the process of testing even the smallest parts of an
            application that can be tested and scrutinising it to check if can operate fully without any unknown problems. This testing can be manually tested by a user or a member from the dev team, it
            can also be tested under automation, perhaps through repetitive actions to check if anything breaks though out using it thousands of times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another element of XP are pair programming. This means there are two programmers, one being the "driver" which writes the code and the other being the "reviewer" which
            continuously reads over each line of code written to reduce programming mistakes or to even help produce more effective solutions or workarounds to add onto the
            current solution.
        </p>

            <img class="card-img-top" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/production-wordpress-assets/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20084133/extreme-programming.gif">
        </center>
    <p> The diagram or flowchart above represents the states in an XP development model as the programmers constantly check up and loop back to the stages already produced
    to make it better.</p>
        <p>
            An obvious advantage in this development methodology is that customer feedback is taken seriously and is pushed after every single update. This allows the website or application to truly
            be catered towards the customers and what they want which in the end, is the goal. The continuous checkup and renovation on every change is also beneficial towards quality and security of the
            change. It allows the code to be refined and bug-free as it is constantly redone and enhanced. A disadvantage however is thar programmers need to be located in the same location so they can
            co-work together. This also means that skill of developers can be lower as they need to sacrifice a better developer for a worse developer but one that lives in the location.

<div class="container" id="Rapid Application Development">
    <div class="card pad">
        <h1 class="subtitle"> Rapid Application Development Model </h1>

        <p> Rapid Application Development Methodology consists of producing a prototype iteratively. A prototype is a reduced in functionality final product. The developers plan and produce the prototype
            and after it is completed, it is shown and tested with customers for feedback and if it's of good enough quality. If not, it is back to revising the plans needed to improve the prototype. This
            could be with design, execution of the plan, revised features or new features added on. Overall, the prototype is tested intensively with the customer until it passes the requirements to where
            the final prototype becomes the final product.
        </p>
        <center>
            <img class="card-img-top" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/RADModel.JPG" width="500" height="500">
        </center>
        <p> An advantage of this development model is that customer feedback is needed intensively so the the customer feedback will improve this prototype tenfold as there is constant criticism towards
        the prototype until it passes the requirements to release as the final product. A downside to this however is that the customer feedback ultimately decides how well the product launches. Being
            very iterative is good, and this development model is, it allows the developers to continuously redo the code of each feature and refine it or even add more features to the product which improves
            the product as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            This development model consists of a rushed timeline to push out a product so it's suggested that this development model is used for firms or companies that have a short window of time to
            produce a product.
        </p>

<div class="container" id="Spiral Model">
    <div class="card pad">
        <h1 class="subtitle"> Spiral Model </h1>

        <p> The Spiral Model is a breed between the Waterfall Model and the Rapid Application Development Model. It uses attributes from the RAD Model such as rushing prototypes to be time efficient and
            produce a good quality, and refined product. However, it splits the iteration cycle into 4 quadrants which means throughout each iteration, the developers need to follow each sequential
            quadrant to produce a finished prototype at the end. This is a very structured method and will most likely produce better results than RAD but consume more time so a bigger time window is needed.
        </p>
        <center>
            <img class="card-img-top" src="http://testingfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/spiralmodel.png">
            </center>
        <p>
            The push of continuous prototypes allow the customers to give feedback and see early versions of this product. This can also give the developers confidence in the project through the
            support gained through the reveal of prototypes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The quadrants are split into 4: Setting objectives and limits, Evaluating alternatives risks, Producing the prototype and planning the next phase.
        </p>
        <p>
            An advantage to this development model is that success is highly dependent on the cost and risk analysis. This means this development model is recommended for projects that risky or costly
            as there is a deep planning and sequential development phase for developing this project. A disadvantage for this development model, is that it's not recommended for low risk projects as a big
            portion of this development model is based on analyzing risk and planning the development. In addition, analyzing the risk involved with the project is tough, and to constantly monitor the stages
            of development to check if they're on track is difficult.
